In this research I am interested in three aspects of development- 1) Children have a vast influence on household resource allocation decisions, implying that policies aimed at supporting parents may generate unintended responses that either reinforce or diminish the welfare effects of the policy. In general, these policies involve complex dynamic tradeoffs for households, mainly in terms of changing labor supply, how much time to spend with the child, and how much formal childcare to purchase in the market. 2) Gender gap in employment in both developed and developing economies. 3) Early childhood development. Specific research projects in these directions are as follows:
