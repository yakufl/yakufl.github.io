Research plays a central role in my teaching as students improve their
analytical skills and master the tools of data analysis through hands-on
experience.

I teach undergraduate course on economic development that
focuses on the economics of developing countries in a comparative perspective
to economic conditions in developed countries. I also teach both introductory 
and intermediate level courses in microeconomics and
macroeconomics.

My teaching portfolio is available upon request.
I teach the following courses at Colorado State University.
