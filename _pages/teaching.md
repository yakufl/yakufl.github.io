Research plays a central role in my teaching as students improve their
analytical skills and master the tools of data analysis through hands-on
experience. I have taught undergraduate course on economic development that
focuses on the economics of developing countries in a comparative perspective
to economic conditions in developed countries. At Colorado State University, I
taught both introductory and intermediate level course in microeconomics and
macroeconomics. I also served as a teaching assistant for course in
introductory to econometrics.

My teaching portfolio is available upon request.
