Welcome! I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics at [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/), and a Data Scientist at [Mountain Data Group](https://www.mountaindatagroup.com/).

I earned my Master of Arts in Economics from the [Department of Economics](http://economics.colostate.edu/) at [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/) in 2019 and my Bachelor of Arts in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics from the Department of Economics and Business at [Colorado College](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/) in 2017. My current research evolves around understanding the behaviors of physicians in response to medical malpractice liability, correlation between circadian rhythms and emotions, and health and racial welfare gaps among the elderly.

Outside the office you'll find me intensely watching EPL games, lifting weight, playing soccer, or hiking.

More information can be found in my [research](https://schinlfc.github.io/research), [teaching]https://schinlfc.github.io/teaching), and [Curriculum vitae](https://schinlfc.github.io/cv)) pages. Feel free to contact me for potential future research collaboration.
