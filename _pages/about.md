I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/), and a Data Scientist at [Mountain Data Group](https://www.mountaindatagroup.com/).

I earned my Master of Arts in Economics from the [Department of Economics](http://economics.colostate.edu/) at [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/) in 2019 and my Bachelor of Arts in Mathematical Economics from [Colorado College](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/) in 2017. My research interests lie in understanding the welfare effects of health and socio-economic inequalities. My research combines rigorous economic theory, econometric and statistical tools, natural language processing algorithms, rich micro data and large-scale simulations to answer important questions at the intersection of public policy and population health and wellbeing.

I have six years of teaching experience as an inclusive pedagogue at the undergraduate level in economics and have taught undergraduate students in principles of microeconomics and macroeconomics, intermediate microeconomics and macroeconomics, and development economics inâ€“person, online and hybrid modalities.

I will be available for interviews at the ASSA meeting in 2022-2023. Link to my [Job Market Paper](/files/pdf/research/Racial_Welfare_Chin_Miller_2022.pdf){: .btn--about}.

For fun you will find me watching [English Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com/) games on the weekend, working out, playing soccer, hiking, or playing guitar and piano. I am a massive jazz, blues, and [Liverpool FC](https://www.liverpoolfc.com/) fan.

More information can be found in my [research](https://schinlfc.github.io/research), [teaching](https://schinlfc.github.io/teaching), and [curriculum vitae](https://schinlfc.github.io/cv) pages.
