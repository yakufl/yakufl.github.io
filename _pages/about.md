I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/).

After completing a MSc in Economics at the [University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/central/en/home.html), Switzerland, I explored Political Economy as a branch of specialization. 

My motivation is to understand the economic system as an evolving process. To do that, I base my research on two pillars, an area of focus and a  methodological approach. My area of focus lies in the interaction between structural change and aggregate demand and how this interaction can shed light on addressing increasing income inequality and asymmetries in the supply side of the economy, such as structural heterogeneity and productivity divergence. My methodological approach lies in evaluating the economy as a complex structure of interdependent sectors, in what can be called a *meso* perspective in Economics.

I am currently doing research on the following topics:

- The Macroeconomic Divergence in the Eurozone
- The Theory of cross-country price differences in International Macroeconomics
