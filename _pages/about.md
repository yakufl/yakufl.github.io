I am currently a Doctoral Candidate in Economics at [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/), and a Data Scientist at [Mountain Data Group](https://www.mountaindatagroup.com/).

I earned my Master of Arts in Economics from the [Department of Economics](http://economics.colostate.edu/) at [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/) in 2019 and my Bachelor of Arts in Mathematical Economics from [Colorado College](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/) in 2017. My research interests lie in understanding the welfare effects of health and socio-economic inequalities. My research combines rigorous economic theory, econometric and statistical tools, natural language processing algorithms, rich micro data and large-scale simulations to answer important questions at the intersection of public policy and population health.

I will be available for interviews at the ASSA meeting in 2022-2023.

For fun you will find me watching [English Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com/) games on the weekend, working out, playing soccer, hiking, or playing guitar and piano. I am a massive jazz, blues, and [Liverpool FC](https://www.liverpoolfc.com/) fan.

More information can be found in my [research](https://schinlfc.github.io/research), [teaching](https://schinlfc.github.io/teaching), and [curriculum vitae](https://schinlfc.github.io/cv) pages.
