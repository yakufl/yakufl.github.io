I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/), and a Data Scientist at [Mountain Data Group](https://www.mountaindatagroup.com/). I earned my Master of Arts in Economics from the [Department of Economics](http://economics.colostate.edu/) at [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/) in 2019 and my Bachelor of Arts in Mathematical Economics from [Colorado College](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/) in 2017. 

I investigate the determinants and consequences of public policy, neighborhood difference, health disparity, and social inequality from a microeconomic perspective. My research topics include the welfare implications of racial inequality in economic and social wellbeing, the inequality of health and economic wellbeing, the neighborhood effects and early life outcomes, and the impact of public policy on population wellbeing. I answer policy relevant questions by applying a diverse set of machine learning techniques and econometric methods including dynamic panel data estimators, natural experiments, microsimulations, and structural estimation. My work is grounded in sound underlying theory but maintains a strong empirical focus with reliance on data driven approaches.

I have six years of teaching experience, including both as a graduate teaching assistant and a graduate teaching instructor at the undergraduate level in economics and have taught undergraduate students in principles of microeconomics and macroeconomics, intermediate microeconomics and macroeconomics, and economic development inâ€“person, online and hybrid modalities.

I will be available for interviews at the ASSA meeting in 2022-2023. Link to my [Job Market Paper](/files/pdf/research/Racial_Welfare_Chin_Miller_2022.pdf){: .btn--research}

For fun you will find me watching [English Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com/) games on the weekend, working out, playing soccer, hiking, or playing guitar and piano. I am a massive jazz, blues, and [Liverpool FC](https://www.liverpoolfc.com/) fan.
