Welcome! I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics at Colorado State University, and a Data Scientist at Mountain Data Group.

I earned my Master of Arts in Economics from the Department of Economics at Colorado State University in 2019 and my Bachelor of Arts  in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics from the Department of Economics & Business at Colorado College in 2017. I am interested in the intersection of health, public and welfare economics, and population and development economics. My current research evolves around understanding the behaviors of physicians in response to medical malpractice liability, correlation between circadian rhythms and emotions using machine learning, and health and racial welfare gaps among the elderly.
