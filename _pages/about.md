## Welcome to my academic website!

Originally from Peru, I am currently a Ph.D. Student in Economics at [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/), located in Fort Collins. There, I am a *Graduate Teaching Assistant*, which means that besides the Ph.D. Program, I give recitations to undergraduate students in Principles of Macroeconomics.

After completing a MSc in Economics at the [University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/central/en/home.html), Switzerland, I explored Political Economy as a branch of specialization. 

### Research Interests


My motivation is to understand economic system as an evolving process. To do that, I base my research on two pillars, an area of focus and a methodological approach. My area of focus lies in the interaction between aggregate demand, market competition and technical change, and how these interactions can shed light on addressing increasing income inequality, market concentration and productivity slowdown. My methodological approach lies in evaluating the economy as a complex structure of interdependent sectors, in what can be called a *meso* perspective in Economics.

I am currently doing research on the following topics:

- Induced technical change
- Political Economy of labor


### More about me

Coming from a low-income family, I am committed to supporting better representation of the disadvantaged groups in academia. In particular, there needs to be a more level presence of academics from the Global South. Feel free to contact me if you think I can help with informal mentoring or feedback on your research.

You are welcome to read my posts on Political Economy in my [blog](https://www.yakufl.org).
