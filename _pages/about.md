**Hi there! I am Sai. Thanks for stopping by!**

I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/), and a Data Scientist at [Mountain Data Group](https://www.mountaindatagroup.com/).

I earned my Master of Arts in Economics from the [Department of Economics](http://economics.colostate.edu/) at [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/) in 2019 and my Bachelor of Arts in Mathematical Economics from [Colorado College](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/) in 2017. I am mainly interested in the intersection of health economics and public economics. My research examines various topics in applied economics, with particular attention to a comprehensive measure of racial welfare inequality and policy evaluation.

My love for economics comes strongly from my own life experiences growing up in a disadvantageous society in Cambodia. It has inspired my exploration to use economics as a tool to conduct my critiques of economic policy in order to advance social change.

For fun you will find me watching [English Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com/) games on the weekend, working out, playing soccer, hiking, or playing guitar and piano. I am a massive jazz, blues, and [Liverpool FC](https://www.liverpoolfc.com/) fan.

More information can be found in my [research](https://schinlfc.github.io/research), [teaching](https://schinlfc.github.io/teaching), and [curriculum vitae](https://schinlfc.github.io/cv) pages.
