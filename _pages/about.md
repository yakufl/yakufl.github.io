## Welcome to my corner in the interweb!

My name is Yaku Fernandez-Landa. I am an independent researcher with completed postgraduate degrees in Economics and Political Economy in Switzerland and the US. On this site, you will discover a showcase of my research work alongside my coding projects.

My area of interest resides at the crossroads of productivity, market structure, aggregate demand, and social metabolism. I am well-versed in heterodox approaches such as Classical Political Economy, post-Keynesianism, and Evolutionary Economics. Methodologically, I evaluate the economy as a complex structure of interdependent sectors, adopting what can be termed a meso perspective in Economics. To achieve this, I adopt computational simulations and economic history as the main tools.

I am originally from Peru. Currently based in Geneva, Switzerland

Recently, my research focuses on the following topics:

- Induced technical change at the sectoral level
- Political Economy of ecological transition
- The microeconomics of complexity: Schumpeter, Penrose and Steindl
