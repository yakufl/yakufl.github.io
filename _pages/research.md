"The Limits of the Wage-led Growth Strategy and the Iron Law of Capitalism: A Theoretical Appraisal" , *The New School Economic Review*, forthcoming.

> The purpose of this paper is twofold. It identifies the recent development of a profound critique of Kaleckian models of growth and distribution that enables the possibility of endogenous regimes. I also present and discuss a theoretical model in which the IS curve is non-linear and demand regimes are unstable. Different theoretical and policy approaches can be fitted in this model, although it is recognized that under the capitalist system, a sort of iron law arises. Thus, it is not possible to permanently pursue the so-called wage-led growth strategy since the regime changes according to the distribution of income.

"Beyond Income: Health, Wealth, and Racial Welfare Gaps Among Older Americans" (joint with Ray Miller), *Review of Economic Dynamics*, journal target [PDF](/files/pdf/research/Racial_Welfare_Chin_Miller_2022.pdf){: .btn--research}

> We estimate racial disparities in well-being among the older U.S. population using an expected utility framework that incorporates differences in consumption, leisure, health, mortality, and wealth. We find large racial disparities in expected welfare later in life. Moreover, disparity measures based on cross-sectional consumption substantially underestimate racial welfare gaps by ignoring disparities in expected elderly health, wealth, and mortality. Our decomposition exercises show that a majority of the estimated welfare gaps are determined by age sixty initial conditions as opposed to racial differences in dynamic processes after age sixty. This suggests that policies aimed at closing racial gaps in late-life may be more successful and efficient if targeted earlier in the life-cycle. In other words, outside of direct wealth transfers, it may largely be too late to target such interventions directly at older populations.
