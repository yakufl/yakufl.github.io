Chin, S., & [Miller, R](https://sites.google.com/rams.colostate.edu/raymiller/home?authuser=0). Beyond Income: Health, Wealth, and Racial Welfare Gaps Among Older Americans [PDF](/files/pdf/research/Racial_Welfare_Chin_Miller_2022.pdf){: .btn--research}

> We estimate racial disparities in well-being among the older U.S. population using an expected utility framework that incorporates differences in consumption, leisure, health, mortality, and wealth. We find large racial disparities in expected welfare later in life. Moreover, disparity measures based on cross-sectional consumption substantially underestimate racial welfare gaps by ignoring disparities in expected elderly health, wealth, and mortality. Our decomposition exercises show that a majority of the estimated welfare gaps are determined by age sixty initial conditions as opposed to racial differences in dynamic processes after age sixty. This suggests that policies aimed at closing racial gaps in late-life may be more successful and efficient if targeted earlier in the life-cycle. In other words, outside of direct wealth transfers, it may largely be too late to target such interventions directly at older populations.

Revise and Resubmit at the *Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization* [PDF](/files/pdf/research/Welfare_Cost_Late-life_Depression.pdf){: .btn--research}

> We quantify the welfare cost of depression among older Americans by estimating a panel VAR model of mental and physical health, labor supply, and consumption using data from the Health and Retirement Study. We use the estimated model and age sixty joint distribution of outcomes to simulate life-cycle paths with and without prevalence of depressive symptoms after age sixty. We estimate that the prevalence of late-life depression costs an average of between 0.85 and 2.1 years in quality-adjusted life expectancy per person. Moreover, depression may result in an average loss of labor supply of up to 1.1 months and lifetime consumption of up to 16,000 US dollars. Combining into a single compensating variation welfare metric, we estimate a bound on the average welfare cost of depression of 8-15% of annual consumption after age sixty. On aggregate, this amounts to roughly 180-360 billion US dollars annually. We also project that while the average welfare cost of late-life depression is declining slightly over birth cohorts, the welfare burden is becoming significantly more unequal.
