My research interests lie in understanding the welfare effects of public policy programs. I am particularly interested in examining health and socio-economic inequalities. My research combines rigorous economic theory, econometric and statistical tools, rich micro data and large-scale simulations to answer important questions at the intersection of public policy and population health. My other main research agenda focuses on understanding the behaviors of physicians in response to medical malpractice liability.

In a new avenue of research, I leverage social media data to explore the effects of daylight savings times on expressed sentiment, gaining insight into some of the potential mechanisms of this policy.

Miller, R., Chin, S., & Sedai, A.K. The Welfare Cost of Late-life Depression

[PDF](/files/pdf/research/Welfare_Cost_Late-life_Depression.pdf){: .btn--research} [Supplemental Information](/files/pdf/research/Depression_Online_Appx.pdf){: .btn--research}
> We quantify the welfare cost of depression among older Americans by estimating a panel VAR model of mental and physical health, labor supply, and consumption using data from the Health and Retirement Study. We use the estimated model and age sixty joint distribution of outcomes to simulate life-cycle paths with and without prevalence of depressive symptoms after age sixty. We estimate that the prevalence of late-life depression costs an average of between 0.85 and 2.1 years in quality-adjusted life expectancy per person. Moreover, depression may result in an average loss of labor supply of up to 1.1 months and lifetime consumption of up to 16,000 US dollars. Combining into a single compensating variation welfare metric, we estimate a bound on the average welfare cost of depression of 8-15% of annual consumption after age sixty. On aggregate, this amounts to roughly 180-360 billion US dollars annually. We also project that while the average welfare cost of late-life depression is declining slightly over birth cohorts, the welfare burden is becoming significantly more unequal.

### Manuscripts in preparation

Chin, S., & Miller, R. Beyond Income: Health, Wealth, and Racial Welfare Gaps Among Older Americans
> We estimate racial disparities in well-being among the older U.S. population using an expected utility framework that incorporates differences in consumption, leisure, health, and mortality. We find large racial disparities in expected welfare later in life that have increased over time. Moreover, disparity measures based on cross-sectional income or consumption substantially underestimate the level and growth in the racial welfare gap by ignoring growing disparities in expected elderly health and mortality. Our decomposition results suggest that roughly 10-12% of the consumption and labor supply gradient at age sixty could be closed by eliminating elderly health differences.

Chin, S., Zahran, S., & Mushinski, D. Physician Behavior, Tort Reform and Defensive Medicine Revisited: An Investigation of Cesarean Deliveries
> We analyze the impact of patient conditions on estimates of defensive medicine (DM). Consistent with theory, we find heterogenous impacts of tort laws across patient conditions. When medical exigencies dictate a c-section, tort laws have no impact on physician decisions.  When physicians  have  latitude  in  their  decision  making,  we  find  evidence  of  DM.  When we estimate a model combining all women and not accounting for patient conditions (such as models estimated in previous studies) we obtain a result which is the opposite of DM, which we call offensive medicine (OM). The OM result appears to arise out of a bias in the difference-in-differences estimator associated with changes in the marginal  distributions  of  patient  conditions  in  control  and  treatment  groups.   The changes in the marginal distributions appear to arise from the impact of tort law on the market for midwives (substitutes for physicians for low-risk women).  Our analysis suggests that not accounting for theoretically expected heterogeneity in physician reactions to changes in tort laws may produce biased estimates of DM.

Chin, S., Zahran, S., & Mushinski, D. Daylight Saving Time Transitions and Expressed Sentiment: Evidence from Twitter
> Daylight saving time (DTS) represents a public good with costs and benefits. We provide the first comprehensive examination of the welfare effects of the spring and autumn transitions for the U.S. Using geocoded Twitter data and a regression discontinuity design, we estimate the effect of the transitions on expressed sentiment. Our results show that individuals experience deteriorations in expressed sentiment in the first week after the spring transition. We find no effect of the autumn transition. We attribute the negative effect of the spring transition to the reduction in the time endowment and the process of adjusting to the disruption in circadian rhythms. We conclude that the higher the shadow price of time, the more difficult is adjustment. Presumably, an increase in flexibility to reallocate time could reduce the welfare loss for individuals with binding time constraints.
